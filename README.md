## Shortcuts

### Can’t live without it

-   [Alt] + [Tab]

    -   Change between open applications (/ Tabs e.g., Microsoft Edge).

-   [Ctrl] + [C]

    -   Copy.

-   [Ctrl] + [V]

    -   Paste.

-   [Ctrl] + [A]

    -   Select all.

-   [Win] + V

    -   Open Visual Clipboard (with history!).

        Less work for my [Alt] + [Tab] keys – I’m sure they are thankful!

-   [Win] + [.]

    -   Open menu with tabs for Emoji, GIF, Kaomoji, Symbols and Clipboard
        history.

        > Finally, I can type my beloved 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash#En_dash">en dash</a>, 
        > correct [German tradition quotation marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#:~:text=German-,%E2%80%9E%E2%80%A6%E2%80%9C,-%E2%80%9A%E2%80%A6%E2%80%98),           [ellipsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis) etc. relatively easy without having to Google / Wikipedia Search and copy-past it (and dying internally) every             time needing them (LIKE FOR EXPRESSING SARCASM).
        AHHHHH, thank you Microsoft for that. :)"

### Extremely handy

-   [Ctrl] + [Delete]

    -   Delete entire word.

        > I discovered it just a few days or weeks ago (today: 02.06.2023) and it
        makes my work so much more efficient – rarely find things such handy
        shortcuts that integrate that fast in my regular working methods.

-   [Ctrl] + [Up Arrow] / [Left Arrow] / [Down Arrow] / [Right Arrow]

    -   Zip Curser to previous paragraph / word / next paragraph / word.

-   [Left Click] on the very right on the Windows Taskbar (a slim button is
    positioned there)  
    (A mousover text / tooltip appears while hovering over it with the mouse
    courser.)

    -   Minimizes all the maximized applications   
        (so you end up on the Windows Desktop).

        -   [Left Click] on it again maximizes all the previously minimized
            applications.

    -   Magic Spell to (most often) fix hung up or stuttering applications.

        > Additional to be able to switch to the Desktop in one click   
        (admittedly I don’t seem to use the function for this purpose often,
        although it probably was mad with that intention in mind), but for me it
        often comes in handy when Windows or some application hangs up or
        stutters – after an application gets minimized by this method and I
        maximize it again (manually or by clicking the button again) , it often
        seems to miraculously catch up again. ✨

-   [Right Mouse Click] on the Windows Taskbar

    -   Open a context menu for running the Task Manager (and Taskbar settings)
        quickly.

### Good to know

-   [Win] + [L]

    -   Switch to the Windows Lock Screen.

-   [Windows Logo Key] + [Space Bar]

    -   Toggle keyboard input language  
        (If different input languages were set up).

### Nice but I keep forgetting it (and should learn it for future me)

-   [Ctrl] + [Up Arrow] / [Left Arrow] / [Down Arrow] / [Right Arrow]

    -   Extend selection to previous line / letter / next line / word.

-   [Ctrl] + [Shift] + [Esc]

    -   Open Task manager.
        > I think it was [Ctrl] + [Alt] + [Del] in the past and I had to look it up to find the “new” shortcut.

-   [Right Mouse Click] on the Taskbar Windows Logo

    -   Open context menu with a list of performable tasks / openable
        applications.

        > Some of the most important menus and tasks (imo) are listed here.

-   [Win] + [,]

    -   Show the Desktop.

        -   Reverts when keys are released.
        > Still have to find some use cases for myself.



### Nice, but not always worth the effort (for me)

## Other Operations

# Elder Scrolls

## Cheats

-   In the cheat menu you do not have to type out the zeros in front of items
    you want to add.

    -   Source: Many websites related to Skyrim / Oblivion cheats state this.

        -   Example:   
            [https://www.pcgamer.com/skyrim-console-commands-let-you-cheat-and-do-other-stuff/\#:\~:text=player.additem%20%5BItem,adds%201000%20gold.](https://www.pcgamer.com/skyrim-console-commands-let-you-cheat-and-do-other-stuff/#:~:text=player.additem%20%5BItem,adds%201000%20gold.)

            -   Statement:  
                Add 1000 Gold to player inventory: `player.additem 0000000f 1000`

    -   Example:   
        Cheat code to add Gold to the player’s inventory: `player.addItem f AMOUNT`
        (instead of AMOUNT type a number / the amount of the item you want to add)

# Visual Studio Code

## Shortcuts

-   [Ctrl] + [C] (without selecting text) with cursor in a line of text:

    -   Copy the whole current line.

    -   [Ctrl] + [V] after this:

        -   Paste the just copied line after the line you just copied.  
            (Even between the current line and a following one!)

# Browser

Note: I use Chrome, but it might Work with other Browser as well.

-   [Ctrl] + ([Shift]) + [Tab]

    -   Move to the Tab (left) right to the currently opened one.
        
        > For all my brothers and sisters in browser tab hoarding out there (thank me later for that!   
        > …   
        > Or perhaps shame on me for enabling you to have even more tabs open without any mayor struggles to switch to them, ahh 🙃).
